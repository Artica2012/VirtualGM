# VirtualGM

A discord bot focused in enhancing the play by Post ttRPG experience.

Goals:
- Light weight streamlined experience
- System agnostic initiative tracker

It does have some reference/lookup that is D&d 4th edition specific, considering adding lookups to other systems in the future.

This project uses the py-cord library for interfacing with discord.
